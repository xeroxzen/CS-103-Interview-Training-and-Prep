def  first_missing_positive(nums):
	"""
	Given an unsorted integer array nums, 
	find the smallest missing positive integer.

	Follow up: Could you implement an algorithm that runs in 
	O(n) time and uses constant extra space.?

	Constraints:

	0 <= nums.length <= 300
	-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

	>>> lst_1 = [1, 2, 0]
	>>> first_missing_positive(lst_1) == 3
	True
	>>> lst_2 = [3,4,-1,1]
	>>> first_missing_positive(lst_2) == 2
	True
	>>> lst_3 = [7,8,9,11,12]
	>>> first_missing_positive(lst_3) == 1
	True
