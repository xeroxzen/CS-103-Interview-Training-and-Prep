Start from integer 1, remove any integer that contains 9 such as 9, 19, 29...

So now, you will have a new integer sequence: 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, ...

Notice there's no digit 9 in the sequence.

Given a positive integer n, you need to return the n-th integer after removing. Note that 1 will be the first integer.
